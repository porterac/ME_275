The bisection method is one such root finding method to find the roots of a function. It is called a bracketing method because it involves 'bracketing' the solution with an initial upper and lower guess.\n",

The benefit to using the maximum iterations criteria is that it acts as a fail safe in case your solution does not converge. If your solution starts to diverge then it will never meet the convergence critera and go on forever. But if you include the maximum iteration criteria then even if your solutions diverge you will exit the loop when the maximum number of iterations is met.\n",
